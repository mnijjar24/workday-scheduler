# Third-Party API's Challenge - Work Day Scheduler 

This work day scheduler is designed for individuals with a busy schedule so that they can add their important events to this planner and manage their time more effectively. This scheduler is set up so the user can see the current date and time at the top of the page. When scrolled down, they are presented with time blocks for standard business hours (9am to 5pm) and have the option to view the time blocks for that day. Furthermore, each time block is colour-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future. Lastly, the events the user enters are saved in local storage so when the page is refreshed, the saved events do not go away!
